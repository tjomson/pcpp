# RxJava

The goal of this week is to get a basic understanding of *reactive programming* and some experience with RxJava (Java implementation of the reactive concepts). More specifically:

- Recognize the key concepts of RxJava in particular Observer/Observable,
- Apply RxJava to program interactive user interfaces handling with RxJava,
- Apply Java Swing to create simple user interfaces.


### Readings
The Goetz book does not cover RxJava, so the reading  this week is mainly on-line material.

This tutorial is a nice [introduction to RxJava](https://www.baeldung.com/rx-java).

This tutorial explains how to set up RxJava and gives a number of "toy" examples
[RxJava Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rxjava/index.htm).

This note introduces to [backpressure](https://www.baeldung.com/rxjava-backpressure).

RxJava is particularly useful for programming interactive user interfaces with buttons, textfields etc. 
To illustrate this we will use 
[Java Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html).
If you are not familiar with Swing, you may find an introduction [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-swing).
You need not study the details of Java Swing to do the exercises. They can be done with copy-paste 
from the examples given in the lecture and the code provided in the week 7 repository on GitHub.

### Suplementary reading

[Reactive programming](http://reactivex.io/) can be done in many other languages eg. JavaScript, C#, and many more.
