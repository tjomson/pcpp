# Lecture 13: Atomicity?

The goal of this week is to get a deeper understanding of atomicity. 

- get a broader understanding of atomicity
- know about various notions of consistency in concurrent systems
- understand the implications of the CAP theorem
- understand how *operation transform* works on text files
- know about *operational transform* in distributed databases
