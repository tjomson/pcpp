# Lecture 10: Lock-free Data Structures

## Goals

The goals of this lecture are:

* Explain and use *compare-and-swap* (CAS) to solve concurrency problems.
* Explain and use `AtomicXX` Java classes.
* Design and use common lock-free data structures.

## Readings

* Goetz:
  * Chapter 15, complete.

* Herlihy:
  * Chapter 10, sections 10.5 and 10.6.
  * Chapter 11, sections 11.1 and 11.2.

### Optional readings

* Herlihy:
  * Chapter 3, Section 3.8.
  * Chapter 9, complete but with emphasis on Section 9.8.
  * Chapter 5, complete (theoretical analysis, read it only if you are interested in why we need compare-and-swap).
