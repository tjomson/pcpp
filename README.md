# Practical Concurrent and Parallel Programming 2022

## (PCPP) E2022

In this MSc course, you learn how to write correct and efficient concurrent and parallel software, primarily using Java, on standard shared-memory multicore hardware. The course covers basic mechanisms such as threads, locks and shared memory as well as more advanced mechanisms such as parallel streams for bulk data, and lock-free data structures with compare-and-swap. It covers concepts such as atomicity, safety, liveness and deadlock. It covers how to measure and understand the performance and scalability of parallel programs. It covers methods to find bugs in concurrent programs. Also, we will take a look at some of the concurrency mechanisms proposed for other programming languages than Java.


## Weekly assignments, slides, code, etc.

Each week we will update this repository with the material used in this week.

## Oral Feedback Sessions Schedule

The schedule below shows the weeks when we will have [oral feedback sessions](general-info/assignment-submissions-and-oral-feedback.md).
Note that this schedule is preliminary and subject to changes.
More precisely, **the dates of the oral feedback sessions will not change**, but the exercises included in each session may vary.

Remember that when you book a slot in the [scheduler in LearnIT](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=161438), the **slot is recurrent, i.e., it is for all the weeks below in the day of the week and time that you selected**.
