# Assignments & Oral Feedback

## Assignment Submission

Assignments are submitted bi-weekly in groups of 2-3 people.
Please use the group selection activity in LearnIT to create/join a group.
If you have problems finding a group, please contact Amund at (amrl@itu.dk).

Every two weeks you submit an assignment with solutions to the exercises carried out the previous two weeks.
**The deadline for submitting assignments is Fridays at 7:59** (before the lecture starts).
We will enable a link in LearnIT for submitting assignments.


### What to submit

Upload your solutions to a repository at ITU's github instance (https://github.itu.dk/).
In the submission form in LearnIT, please write the link (`<url>`) to the repository containing the solution.
Please check that it is possible to fetch your solution with a command like `$ git clone <url>`.
Please also write in your submission: your group name, and the full names and Github usernames of all the members of the group.

**All members of a group should make a submission via learnIT**, even if you all submit for the same group. 
This is important because each member of the group must get an individual grade.
Also learnIT submissions are used to check whether students have fulfilled the requirements for taking the exam.

The GitHub repository you submit should only have files related to the submission and follow the structure shown here: ([Assignment1/](Assignment1/)).
 
Furthermore, it should only have one branch. You may not modify any files in the submitted repository after submission. 
If you want to continue working on the submitted files, make a new copy of all files that you need for other work after the submission.

The code of mandatory assignments must compile and run in order for the submission to be approved.


## Oral Feedback
For oral feedback sessions, please have the code and explanation in your submissions ready before the feedback session starts. 
Be ready to compile/execute your code and open it in an editor. 
We will ask you both to explain and run (some of) the code. 
All members of a group should contribute, so prepare who will (primarily) talk about which parts of the solution.

### Booking
Each group needs to join a 40min slot for oral feedback with TAs or teachers.
Note that slots allow for 6 people, so more than one group can join a slot.
**You must book a 40min slot using the [scheduler activity from LearnIT](https://learnit.itu.dk/mod/scheduler/view.php?id=161438).**
The slot you choose is recurrent: it will take place on weeks 38, 40, 43, 46, 48 and 49 on the selected day and time.
Any member of the group can book the slot on behalf of the group.
TAs and teachers will make available several 40min slots from which you can choose.




You may choose to have oral feedback sessions via Zoom or in person.
Please indicate your preference in the comments when booking the slot.
Amund is only available via Zoom, so please select Amund's slots if you would like to have oral feedback sessions via Zoom.
Otherwise, Frederik and Jørgen/Raúl prefer in-person oral feedback sessions (although they can do sessions in Zoom if necessary).
The TAs or teachers will take care of creating a Zoom event, or booking a physical room at ITU.

If you cannot attend any of the available slots, please contact Amund (amrl@itu.dk) or Frederik (mfrm@itu.dk).

### Preparation for oral feedback

For your oral feedback sessions, **you should have your assignment ready to show either on a projector or via screen sharing.**
During the session, the TAs or teachers will assess whether the assignment is approved. 
We seek to discuss the assignments with you to 

- better assist you in uncovering misunderstandings in your solutions, and 
- train you in discussing course material.

Therefore, you are encouraged to talk about course material that you find difficult to understand.

#### Written Feedback

It is possible to get written feedback. Though, in our experience, engaging discussions are more stimulating and better contribute to the learning process. This is the reason why we adopt oral feedback sessions. Nevertheless, we would like to keep this possibility open.
If you would like to get written feedback, please go to the scheduler activity, select a time slot and write in the comments "I would like to have written feedback."
Then, the teacher or TA will provide written feedback for that group, and there will be no oral session.
When requesting written feedback, please try to select slots with Frederik.
